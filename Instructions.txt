Configure Your System:
1. open 2 windows;
2. in the first window, enter "erl -name node_1@127.0.0.1";
3. in the second window, enter "erl -name node_2@127.0.0.1";
4. in any one of the windows, enter "gossip_application:init(YOUR_UNIQUE_CONFIG_FILE)";
5. in both of the windows, enter "gossip_node:run(YOUR_NODE_CONFIG_FILE_FOR_THIS_NODE)";

test:
1. in any of thw windows, enter "userverProcName ! testLongestWord";
2. in any of thw windows, enter "userverProcName ! testMostFreqWord";
3. in any of thw windows, enter "userverProcName ! testWhichNodes";

notes:
1. You must first make sure you configure file is correct;
2. YOUR_UNIQUE_CONFIG_FILE is the only config file for init process;
3. YOUR_NODE_CONFIG_FILE_FOR_THIS_NODE is differernt for each nodes, in the case you have 2 nodes, you have 2 differnt these fils.
4. For now, testWhichNodes" will not work since don't implement how to accept word list from user input yet.
